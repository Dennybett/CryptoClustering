# AI Bootcamp Module 11 Challenge

## Principal Component Analysis

### Crypto_Clustering

#### Project description

In this challenge, I will apply the KMeans algorithm and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price flactuations. 

The price flactuations will be in intervals spanning from 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 200 days and 1 year. 

Such analysis is important for crypto currency enthusiasts as it provides insights into the data and consequently helps in their investment decisions.
